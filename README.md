## ðŸ¤” Why did I build this?
I applied for [TKS](https://tks.world) and was offered the ability to apply for a full ride scholarship. The challenge application required me to solve a problem using emerging technologies in 14 days, so I chose artificial intelligence and got straight to work on this concept. Update: The project was accepted and I was granted the full ride!
